                <p>“Avengers: Endgame” is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster filmmaking, the result of years of work from thousands of people. It is designed to be the most blockbuster of all the blockbusters, a movie with a dozen subplots colliding, and familiar faces from over 20 other movies. It’s really like nothing that Hollywood has produced before, existing not just to acknowledge or exploit the fans of this series, but to reward their love, patience, and undying adoration.</p>

This book teaches younger generations that in 1969, astronauts Collins, Aldrin, and Armstrong accomplished what others said could not be done. This story depicts these brave astronauts and their exciting voyage to the Moon.
With vivid illustrations by Benrei Huang, the book shows how the astronauts traveled to the Moon, and how people in the control room in Houston helped the astronauts on the Eagle land in Tranquility Base while people on Earth watched in anticipation on their TVs.<br>
